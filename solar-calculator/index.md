## Rated power

1.	If it is a solar-VFD-motor system, please input the rated power of the motor.
2.	If it is the on-grid inverter or charge controller, please input the rated power of the on-grid inverter or charge controller.

## Ratio

Please input the maximum and the minimum values of the ratio of the solar array to the load.

Tipï¼šThe power of the photovoltaic array generally cannot exceed 1.1 times the rated power of the on-grid inverter or charge controller.

## Voltage

Please input the maximum and minimum values of the voltage of the inverter or the VFD or the charge controller.
